**Delve** is a Ruby-on-Rails webapp that aims to help you manage you documents.
No more delving into boxes full of unsorted paperwork! Delve will help you to scan, tag, index and retrieve documents to save you precious time when you're in a hurry.

Delve is under initial development, but its core functionality of scanning,
storing and later finding documents works. You can view the Issues for some of
the things we have planned.

Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/delve/wiki) for
instrusctions on how to get started!

# History

Delve is strongly inspired/influenced
by [OpenDIAS](http://opendias.essentialcollections.co.uk) and many of
it's features are present in Delve.
