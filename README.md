# Delve

**Delve** is a Ruby-on-Rails webapp that aims to help you manage you documents.
No more delving into boxes full of paper! Delve is strongly inspired/influenced
by [OpenDIAS](http://opendias.essentialcollections.co.uk).

Delve is under initial development, but its core functionality of scanning,
storing and later finding documents works. You can view the Issues for some of
the things we have planned.

Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/delve/wiki) for
instrusctions on how to get started!
